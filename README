==================

The exercise's purpose is to construct a four in a row game. The game is played on a board
  between players so that every turn, one disk is added to a column that is not already full.
  Once a player creates a streak of four consecutive disks horizontally, diagonally or vertically
  he is declared the winner.

AI Algorithm:
  Algorithm of ai in the next order:
  #1)find turn for finish the game(four disks of ai in a row)
  #2)find how to block sequence of 4 disk of opponent
  #3)find turn to make sequence of ai disk 3 in a row
  #4)find how to block sequence of opponent 3 in a row
  #5) find how to create sequence 2 in a row
  #6)check if the turn close to the middle of the board
  #7)in the end it checks if after best turn there is a situation that
  #opponent will win if he puts his disk on the disk that was put by ai in the last turn
  #for each of checking there is a value according to importance of it

  the most important for ai is victory.
  according to this algorithm the turn will contains most possible number
  of lengthening of the sequence,or blocking and lengthening in the best way
  and after that will be checked if after that turn there is no winning turn for opponent.
